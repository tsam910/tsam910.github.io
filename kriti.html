				<p>Kriti is the college magazine of my college (Jaypee Institute of Information Technology). It was started by our seniors in 2007-08, but it got inactive as those seniors graduated. It used to come in newspaper form with glossy pages (somewhat like the 3-4 page specials that come with newspapers). In 2012, a few students thought of relaunchin it, but in a magazine form. I worked in the design team of Kriti.</p>

				<p>Working in Kriti was a fun experience, because I learned a lot. Fist were the discussions about how to get sponsors, preparing a small pitch for them, going to a nearby mall and trying to sell ad space. Then there was the challenge of completing it and getting the prints before our exams, so we started designing pages as soon as we got the content. After we got the sponsorships sorted and had most of the pages designed, we talked to and bargained with a couple of printers to print our magazine. After the printer was finalized, when we were giving him the designs to be pritned and thought that everything was done, we realized that you needed to create files in different formats for print. It was the first time making anything for mass print for all of us, and we didn't have much time, so we had just started out without researching or asking anyone more experienced. First of all, we needed to use CMYK color mode, but we used RGB, since that's what we were used to. Then we also had to leave some bleeding margin and some cutting margin, but we didn't. Eventually I had to sit down at the printer's factory with a technician for a few hours and correct everything. This experience taught me to always do a bit of research before starting anything.</p>
