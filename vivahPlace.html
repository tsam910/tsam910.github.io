					Vivah Place was meant to be a portal for wedding organizing. The idea was to provide information, inspiration and resources about everything wedding related in a single place. Vivah Place was the brainchild of a college friend of mine, Tarun Kaushik, who had already done research and some ground work on it before contacting me. After a few discussions, he, another friend of ours, Sahil, and me started working on making the website. Initially, my role was to be the designer, but as we started working, I also coded the whole front-end myself.

				After working pretty hard for a few months, when we were not too far from launching the alpha version, we stumbled upon a marketing and revenue generation problem. We decided that it would be best to put the project on hold for the time being. This was a hard decision to make for all of us. It meant that all the hard work we done in the last few months, all the dreams we had seen were going be a waste. But this wasn't the main reason for the decision being hard. My personal view is that we keep doing a lot of work and to not do something because of the fear that it won't produce results is like limiting yourself; and a few months are anyway not a lot if you compare it to a career which is going span over 3-4 decades. The hardest part was accepting that we were quitting. When you build something new, you have to ready for criticism, opposition and sacrifices. It gets hard and at many times you feel like you'd be much better off doing something else. You can't go through it without totally blocking out even the slightest possibility of quitting. But again, there's a limit to everything. You can say that you want to punch a wall till it breaks and you will never give up, but if you still continue after your knuckles start bleeding, it's just plain stupid. It is basically passion v/s wisdom in decisions like this and we like to believe that we acted wise.
