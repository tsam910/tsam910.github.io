		<h1>Point Of Sale System - Realbox Media - 2013-4</h1>

				<p>A Point Of Sale(POS) system is basically the end point where a customer's order is punched in and the bill is generated. Enriched versions of POS also have other features like salary management systems, inventory management systems, analytics etc. The market is already filled with hundreds of POS's but the problem with them is that they were build to be sold to business owners and not to solve their problems. Our vision while creating this POS was to make a system for restaurants which provides a unique and friendly experience to both the restaurant staff and the customer they are serving</p>

				<p>We started with brainstorming about how technology can help create a better experience in this domain. For example, when a customer calls, depending of if it is a new customer or a repeat one, the system can suggest a script to follow. If it is a customer that the restaurant has served before, the system can analyze the previous order, and show custom offers and suggestions. Since it already has their address, the system can also calculate the time it will take for the delivery and display it to the call-taker. And all of this, before the call is even picked up. We discussed and implemented these and lots of other cool features. The final product was an android phone and an iPad. All the calls are received and made through that phone (which has modified OS, so that all the tasks that have to be done on it can be done easily), and all the data, analytics and functionalities of the POS are there on the iPad</p>

				The main challenge here was that the system was to be used by people not very familiar with technology. And not only did they lack intuitiveness about computer and technology, they were used to earlier POS systems which were generally not made with a focus on UI and UX. So while we were making UIs that easiest and fastest to use, we could not deviate so much away from old (and most of the time inefficient) UIs that the servers were used to. My role in the project was designing and developing the UI of the iPad application and It took us about 5 months of research, interaction with target users (servers), design and development to come up with a product which is being very well received in its domain.
