		I was hired by OrangeTwig as UI/UX Designer, so that was my first job purely as a designer. But I love coding, plus the results are better if the same person designs and codes since there's nothing lost in communication, so very soo I started coding too.

		OrangeTwig is used by small online business for social media marketing. A lot of the users are old people who are bad with computers, so many times we've had to sacrifice simplicity and beauty for clarity and ease of use, but that's fine because the product's purpose is to usable over beautiful.
