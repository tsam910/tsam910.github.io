	Realbox was my first real job. I met Saurabh Sir (my boss at Realbox) at a hackathon in September 2012. He was working on a product which he showed to the people present there. I was very impressed with the UI & UX and attention to the detail paid in it. That was something that I wanted to learn. I showed him some of my projects, he asked me some questions and offered me to come and work with him. Incidentally, the office was just a couple of kilometres from my college, so I agreed. At that time, it was only the two of us working in Realbox, and we didn't have another addition to the team for another 8 months. It took almost a year since my joining for us to find another person to join the tech team. This was mainly because we really loved our work and were very particular about it. We used to scrap code that took us weeks to write if we didn't feel it was good enough. I worked as the UI designer and developer on a few very cool products during my stay. Most of the products were iPad applications related to restaurants. Out topmost priority had always been creating a good experience for the users, and I learned a lot about UI/UX because of this.

	Different products we made posed different challenges for us. The main source of challenge was always the target audience. Some of our products were to be used by restaurant staff, some were to be used by restaurant customers and some by restaurant owners. These three groups had different kinds of experience with technology. For example, a server in a restaurant is not generally very familiar with iPad and its applications. He cannot be expected to understand what even the most basic icons mean, but it is expected of him to get confused and tap on the wrong buttons very often. Because of this, we had to make each and every screen very intuitive and have clear separation of functionalities, along with easy undoing of actions. His typing would also be very slow, so we had to consider that and keep the typing to the absolute minimum. On the other hand, a restaurant owner would own an iPhone and be very familiar with facebook, so we could use his knowledge of facebook design to our advantage. Another factor was the usage of the application. A restaurant customer would only use the application once every couple of weeks, so that application needed to have pretty animations to create a wow experience, but the restaurant staff would use the application mutliples time a day and elaborate animations would just be a waste of time and source of annoyance for them. Their priority had to be responsiveness and the flow of the application. We considered each of these points and a lot more while designing applications and did a lot of beta testing with the target users before finally launching any product.

	Since leaving Realbox, I've constantly been in touch with them - helping them a couple of projects and giving lectures to batches of new hires.
