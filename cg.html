		<h1>Rebranding - Campusghanta - 2013 </h1>
			<div class="banner1">

			<div class="img-info">
				<p>Campusghanta is a youth entertainment portal which writes about politics, humor, sports, music and every other thing, in its own twisted style. I joined CG in 2012 as a comic writer. From there, I also did some graphic design, web design, marketing, writing, editing and training (training designing and tech interns). I wanted to and was encouraged to do whatever I could. We would sit at different cafes and plan articles, comics and reviews to be published in the coming week. We would discuss how to make viral content, and make strategies for creating and selling posters, tshirts and other merchandise. It was the first time I experienced what running a startup feels like, and most of the little people-skills I have, I learned there.</p>

				<p>Till 2012, campushghanta had been using a premium wordpress theme and a logo with variable typeface. In January 2013, we were growing, both in terms of members and work ,and decided that it was time we created a new brand identity for CG. We wanted something catchy and totally different. CG was an anything-goes platform. We never tried to be politically correct or censor language. The design needed to reflect that. It had to be cool, yet energetic. The one word which we usually describe CG with needed to be reflected in the design, 'bhasad' (roughly translates to chaos). It took me around two months to finalize the theme. Since then, every graphic of CG has been in sync with it.</p>
